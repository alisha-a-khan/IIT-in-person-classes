37,MBA 511,Marketing Strategy,Business Graduate Tuition Rate,"This course provides an introduction to the practice and strategy of marketing. Marketing activities are those processes and functions that enable managers and policy-makers to identify and serve the values and needs of a customer given the capacities of the company, activities of competitors, and inherent constraints in the business environment. Marketers typically refer to these concepts as the ""four C's."" Based on their understanding of the ""four C's,"" students will then learn how to implement strategy by applying the levers of the marketing mix. These elements are known as the four P's (product, price, place/channels of distribution, and promotion). The treatment of marketing constraints and marketing mix will be motivated by essential foundations from economics, sociology, and consumer behavior. Over the course of the semester, students are expected to transition from thinking about these concepts in isolation to a dynamic, integrative framework. This process includes using the marketing strategy framework to assess business and policy problems from a ""multiple objective"" perspective: that is, the student will be asked to think about how marketing activities along with those of competitors and collaborators will affect the profitability, sustainability, social, and ethical standing of the firm. The synthesis of these concepts will be carried out through the use of case studies, problem sets, classroom lectures, discussions, and a field project. There will also be a midterm and final exam. The pedagogical style of the course emphasizes the students' role in applying the concepts discussed in the lectures to the situations at hand. The role of the instructor is to provide tools to structure thinking and to stimulate and facilitate analysis of the cases.",Fall 2020,Class,6,,10,4,10867,"Graduate Business, Graduate, Undergraduate",Lecture,Robert Nelson,TBA,F,6pm - 8:30pm

181,LAW 616,First Amendment,CK Law Tuition Rate,"During the past couple of decades, a variety of critical theories of law have been developed, e.g., critical legal studies, communitarianism, critical race theory, pragmatism, deconstruction, postmodernism, and different varieties of non-liberal feminism. The starting point for all of these theories is a rejection of classical liberal legal theory, which is criticized, on the one hand, for its alleged moral relativism and, on the other hand (and seemingly inconsistently), for its assumption that there are certain fundamental, universal moral principles which provide the foundation for any valid legal system. This seminar will explore and contrast the basic premises of classical liberal legal theory and the various critical theories. Is classical liberal legal theory morally agnostic? Do the critical theorists espouse certain moral values and principles and, if so, can they consistently do so while claiming to be anti-foundation lists? To what extent do the moral values and principles ( if any) espoused by the critical theorists differ from those (if any ) espoused by classical liberal theory ?",Fall 2020,Class,6,,15,9,14140,"Graduate Business, Master of Laws, Law, Non Credit",Seminar,Steven Heyman,TBA,M,2pm - 3:50pm

The studio focuses on developing core drawing, making, thinking, and communication skills via a series of discrete projects that aggregate into a comprehensive body of work. Analytical investigation of the techniques and methods of architectural design and representation are interwoven with an analytical investigation of site, place, inhabitation, and elemental spatial archetypes. The studio is largely comprised of two primary projects (Composite City and Inhabited Archetypes), with specific internal phases and deliverables, structured to operate as a complementary whole. Composite City comprises a series of studies in drawing, modeling and making that dissect the layers, components and phenomena of the built environment, via questions of narrative, memory, space, tectonics, systems and compositions. Inhabited Archetypes comprises a series of spatial explorations that employ the preceding analyses as sites of operation. Four archetypes (bridge, tower, wall, stair) prompt fundamental questions of architectural space (tectonics and inhabitation) and design processes. Working iteratively and comparatively, each archetype will be a medium to investigate issues of structure, skin, thickness, thinness, material, assembly, inhabitation and narrative.

1391,ARCH 543,Architecture Studio III,Standard Tuition Rate,"The design studio focuses on the design and structural engineering of high-volume residential buildings, or “housing.” The design of housing in cities such as Chicago is a story of bold experimentation and innovation, but also contradictions and controversy. Chicago has been at the forefront of developing new types of public and private housing and design strategies to improve and maintain public health since the city’s founding in the mid 19th century. Students are exposed to a variety of housing and hybrid buildings, and undertake research projects in select cities around the world to compare and contrast a variety of issues such as: density, dwelling unit types, mixed use programing, materiality, development models, cultural norms, and relationships between functionality and luxury. The studio is structured around three primary assignments beginning with research and drawing assignments of housing types in Chicago, followed by analyses of dense, urban housing projects in global cities, to the final design project. The studio’s principle concern is giving form, shape, and character to collectively inhabited high-rise buildings, and to the streets and public spaces that surround them. Several lectures, presentations and field trips throughout the semester highlight discernable and meaningful connections between people and places, movement and morphology, natural resources and the artificial fabric of the city. A particular focus is on place-making, environmental stewardship, social equity, and economic vitality of urban neighborhoods. The studio operates as a laboratory in which to explore new possibilities for urban living in Chicago, specifically within a selected neighborhood and project site.",Fall 2020,Class,65,,80,15,10634,"Graduate Business, Graduate",Studio,Thomas Brock,TBA,MWF,1:50pm - 5:50pm

2036,MAX 504,Marketing Strategy,Business Graduate Tuition Rate,"This course provides an introduction to the practice and strategy of marketing. Marketing activities are those processes and functions that enable managers and policy-makers to identify and serve the values and needs of a customer given the capacities of the company, activities of competitors, and inherent constraints in the business environment. Marketers typically refer to these concepts as the ""four C's."" Based on their understanding of the ""four C's,"" students will then learn how to implement strategy by applying the levers of the marketing mix. These elements are known as the four P's (product, price, place/channels of distribution, and promotion). The treatment of marketing constraints and marketing mix will be motivated by essential foundations from economics, sociology, and consumer behavior. Over the course of the semester, students are expected to transition from thinking about these concepts in isolation to a dynamic, integrative framework. This process includes using the marketing strategy framework to assess business and policy problems from a ""multiple objective"" perspective: that is, the student will be asked to think about how marketing activities along with those of competitors and collaborators will affect the profitability, sustainability, social, and ethical standing of the firm. The synthesis of these concepts will be carried out through the use of case studies, problem sets, classroom lectures, discussions, and a field project. There will also be a midterm and final exam. The pedagogical style of the course emphasizes the students' role in applying the concepts discussed in the lectures to the situations at hand. The role of the instructor is to provide tools to structure thinking and to stimulate and facilitate analysis of the cases.",Fall 2020,Class,18,,20,2,11913,"Graduate Business, Graduate, Undergraduate",Lecture,Robert Nelson,TBA,F,6pm - 8:30pm
