The focus is on the strategic role of operations and technology decisions as a source of competitive advantage for the firm with an emphasis on the integration of R & D/Design/Engineering, operations and marketing within the context of the business unit's strategy, and the organizational structure and skills needed to execute and manage the operating system. The overal goal is to create, achieve, and sustain operational effectiveness. The course will emphasize the analytical tools and techniques that are useful in making decisions about projection facilities and capacity, choices of technology and equipment, task and process design, organizational architecture, human resources policies, and the physical and managerial control of operations. Students will gain an understanding of the economics of operations including trade-offs between fixed and variable costs, marginal/incremental analysis to identify relevant versus sunk costs, optimization, and productivity measurements for both capital and labor. Case studies will provide opportunities for students to develop their skills in process design and choice, process mapping, critical thinking, identification of problems versus symptoms, process improvement, and capacity measurement in the context of the business strategy while the simulations will provide an opportunity to practice the management of a particular operating system. Students will also gain an understanding of how human behavior and organizational design, along with quantitative optimization, forms the theoretical underpinning of operations management.",

    "description": "This course provides an introduction to the practice and strategy of marketing. Marketing activities are those processes and functions that enable managers and policy-makers to identify and serve the values and needs of a customer given the capacities of the company, activities of competitors, and inherent constraints in the business environment. Marketers typically refer to these concepts as the \"four C's.\" Based on their understanding of the \"four C's,\" students will then learn how to implement strategy by applying the levers of the marketing mix. These elements are known as the four P's (product, price, place/channels of distribution, and promotion). The treatment of marketing constraints and marketing mix will be motivated by essential foundations from economics, sociology, and consumer behavior. Over the course of the semester, students are expected to transition from thinking about these concepts in isolation to a dynamic, integrative framework. This process includes using the marketing strategy framework to assess business and policy problems from a \"multiple objective\" perspective: that is, the student will be asked to think about how marketing activities along with those of competitors and collaborators will affect the profitability, sustainability, social, and ethical standing of the firm. The synthesis of these concepts will be carried out through the use of case studies, problem sets, classroom lectures, discussions, and a field project. There will also be a midterm and final exam. The pedagogical style of the course emphasizes the students' role in applying the concepts discussed in the lectures to the situations at hand. The role of the instructor is to provide tools to structure thinking and to stimulate and facilitate analysis of the cases.",

The duty to obey law presupposes that laws are both consistent and just: because they sometime aren't, difficult cases arise in which appeals to a higher political morality become necessary if justice is to be served. But what is this higher political morality and what is its connection to the institutions we rely upon to do justice and protect our human rights as well as to the laws that are actually produced? Is this higher political morality the morality of our society or something broader? And, if it is something broader, how do we discover what it is? In this course, we will attempt to answer these and other questions by considering the relationship between legal and political philosophy, showing how the former is incomplete without the latter. Taking the problem of how to solve difficult cases as our point of departure, we will look at the inherent incompleteness of conventional theories of law with the idea of developing a meta-theory that would enable judges to decide difficult cases by drawing upon the best available theory of politics appropriate to the case's level of abstraction. By so doing, it is hoped that we will be able to produce resolutions for some kinds of controversial cases and open doors to the way we should think about others. It is also hoped that the course will provide an avenue for a broad critique of the way legal and political institutions operate including the way law schools educate and judges actually decide cases.",

We will begin by studying the non-legal texts that have helped construct contemporary understandings of sexual behavior and attraction. We will then move on to explore (i) the extent to which the law regulates same-sex sex itself, (ii) the constitutional treatment of gay men and lesbians as a class, (iii) the extent to which expressions of sexual identity can be protected as speech, and (iv) the state of the law of workplace discrimination as it pertains to gay men and lesbians. We will conclude by evaluating gay and lesbian families, paying particularly close attention to the legal treatment of gay couples and legal treatment of gay parents. Three credit hours .\n[Prof. Samar's section] Despite important recent changes at the local, state, and national levels, and in some foreign countries and the European Union, to protect gay men, lesbians, bisexuals, and transgendered persons (LGBT) from discrimination and to recognize same-sex relationships, society's attitude toward homosexuality and transgendered issues continues to be ambivalent. This is especially true in respect to marriage and child rearing, as we see in the current debates over same-sex marriage, but it is also found in the attitudes of states that fail to protect against public and private employment discrimination, and in the federal government's \"Don't Ask/Don't Tell\" policy to keep openly gay persons from serving in the military. This course/seminar will explore the possibility of finding a legal, philosophical or political framework for approaching LGBT issues by critically looking at various conceptions of homosexuality and society's purported justifications for affecting this behavior, against its broader concerns for guaranteeing social liberty and human equality. It will then apply this understanding to the interaction between gays and the criminal justice system; discrimination in public employment (including military service) and private employment; first amendment issues posed by gay teachers in public schools and universities; the legal problems faced in establishing same-sex relationships (especially\nmarriage) in Massachusetts and elsewhere; and the legal problems gay people confront in matters pertaining to child custody and visitation rights. Central to the course will be locating possible interpretations for the Supreme Court's 2003 interpretation in Lawrence v. Texas, and its 1996 decision in Romer v. Texas. This particular area of the law is really several areas as they relate to gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgendered people. LGBT have been a kind of exception to the way the law traditionally operates, and this exception cannot usually be made sense of in terms of traditional legal thinking. For this reason the course will engage a certain degree of theoretical abstraction to undersand, clarify and hopefuly improve the law in these areas. Two credit hours.",

In the first semester, the course teaches students how to conduct legal research, both in print materials and through computer research. The class also teaches students the academic standards of proper attribution, quotation, and plagiarism, including some training in how to put citations inproper BlueBook format. In addition, students are instructed and tutored in writing and lega writing fundamentals such as proper sentence construction, precision and clarity, proper word choices, organixation, and use of thesis and topic sentences. Students receives extensive written feedback on their draft from the professors, after which a conference is held with each student to provide oral feedback and reply to questions from the student. By the end of the first semester, students have written the title, introduction, and Part I of their papers. In the second semester, the class teaches students how to write the normative section offering a solution to the problem discussed in the descriptive section, the section responding to criticisms of the proposal, and the conclusion of the paper. Students learn how to revise their papers and self-assess their papers to ensure they satisfy all of the formatting and writing requirements taught in the course. During the second semester, students turn in several drafts of their papers and receive written and oral feedback for each part, with individual conferences with the professors after each draft. By the end of the second semester, students turn in the final completed paper and receive a letter grade for their work in the course.",

A key objective of the course is to develop tools useful in other Stuart courses. Economics is a key foundation for much of what is taught in finance, marketing, business strategy, environmental management, and virtually every other course in the graduate program. Economics is a way of thinking about problems, issues, and decisions that managers face in each of the functional areas of their organization. It stresses the importance of incentives in impacting human decision making and emphasizes the consideration of costs and benefits when making decisions. The course introduces and develops concepts in areas of microeconomics such as competition and market structure, incentive contracts, and pricing. Topics covered range from the most basic demand and supply models to principal-agent models and economics of information. The course will also touch on some of the primary macroeconomic topics (including GDP, inflation, and unemployment), topics in game theory (simultaneous and sequential games), and issues of ethics in economic policy-making pertaining to competitive and oligopolistic markets, pricing, and trade.",

The starting point for all of these theories is a rejection of classical liberal legal theory, which is criticized, on the one hand, for its alleged moral relativism and, on the other hand (and seemingly inconsistently), for its assumption that there are certain fundamental, universal moral principles which provide the foundation for any valid legal system. This seminar will explore and contrast the basic premises of classical liberal legal theory and the various critical theories. Is classical liberal legal theory morally agnostic? Do the critical theorists espouse certain moral values and principles and, if so, can they consistently do so while claiming to be anti-foundation lists? To what extent do the moral values and principles ( if any) espoused by the critical theorists differ from those (if any ) espoused by classical liberal theory ?",

As markets become more global and as legal mechanisms are developed to respond to these changes, it becomes critically important for lawyers and policy-makers to grasp these developments. They are already of major importance in areas such as competition law, intellectual property law, environmental law and the like, and they are of growing importance in many other areas of law. They are likely to increase in importance in these importance in each of these areas. The seminar will seek to develop tools for effectively examining globalization effects in a variety of areas, depending, in large part, on areas of student interest.",

It is likely to become even more important as the globalization of economic activity advances. This course is designed to introduce students to this area of law and to the basic tools they will need to understand and provide legal services in it. We will examine U.S. antitrust law as it relates to transactional conduct. We will then look at antitrust law in Europe and, in a superficial way, other parts of the world. The final section of the course will deal with recent developments in international antitrust cooperation and with moves toward the development of a transnational antitrust regime.",

Additionally, for twelve (12) hours a week students work on client service and drafting projects with the Center for Access to Justice & Technology (CAJT), whose mission is to provide low-income individuals with greater access to the legal system through the use of internet technology. The practicum provides students with experience in assisting self-represented litigants and providing legal information to low-income individuals. Students will also draft automated court forms and instructions for pro se litigants and the public. A variety of legal topics are available for student projects, including landlord/tenant, domestic relations and consumer rights. These drafting projects include the following activities: researching, drafting, and editing Web-based legal education materials and legal forms with instructions for the public, and developing plain language user interfaces for Web based document assembly. Some audio/video production may be used in creating these materials. The practicum requires twelve (12) hours per week spent on practicum activities outside of class.

First, law and legal disputes are increasingly becoming more global, so that knowledge of other legal systems with different procedural and doctrinal structures, especially those based on the European civil law tradition rather than the Anglo-American common law tradition, as well as law promulgated by international organizations such as the European Court of Human Rights, is becoming increasingly important to everyday legal practice. Second, studying how other legal systems deal with various substantive and procedural issues can provide useful insights for how those issues might be better dealt with in our legal system. The premise of this course is that the benefits of studying comparative law can be best obtained by focusing on a specific area of law, which however encompasses issues and doctrines that are fundamental to all of law. Tort law is such an area.",

Deep networks can be trained with a single end-to-end model and\u00a0 bypass the need for traditional task-specific feature engineering. In this way deep learning simplifies learning tasks and allows using developed models to new tasks. Deep networks are suitable for parallel processing implementations and can easily leverage intensive computational resources. The course will focus on mathematical concepts, numerical algorithms, principles, GPU frameworks, and applications of deep learning. Topics include deep feedforward networks, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and deep generative models with applications to data analysis, computer vision, and natural language processing. Several programming assignments and a project will practice the application of deep learning techniques to actual problems.

    "description": "This seminar will focus on the role that is properly played by non-judicial institutions (primarily Congress and the President) in determining what the Constitution requires. For example: May the President elect not to enforce federal law because he thinks doing so would be unconstitutional? When Congress and the President formulate their positions as to what the Constitution means, are they limited to using the same reasoning that courts use, or may they take account of additional considerations? Our study will have the added benefit of clarifying the role that courts play in interpreting the Constitution. It also will shed light on what the Constitution \u00bfis,\u00bf what role the Constitution plays in our democratic liberal regime, and how the Constitution changes over time. We will approach these issues by reading historical materials, constitutional jurisprudence, and several case studies. Possible topics include (1) national security issues, primarily the relation between the President's commander-in-chief powers and Congress' assorted war-making powers; (2) the constitutionality of secession; (3) the impeachment process; (4) executive privilege; and (5) equal protection. Students will be expected to write a paper. Prerequisite: Constitutional Law.",

    "description": "This seminar aims to give an overview of European Community (EC) competition law, introducing students to the comparison of EC and US antitrust principles, along with some references to competition rules in EC Member States. The first part of the seminar will focus on the justifications and the goals of EC competition policy, highlighting linkages between antitrust rules and EC Treaty principles of free movement and market integration. The second part will deal with a selection of EC competition law topics: vertical and horizontal agreements, abuse of a dominant position, merger control, state aids and state action in general. Finally, a few classes will be devoted to the presentation of selected issues regarding enforcement, both public and private, and a wrap-up. The seminar will be case-law focused, with a preference for cases that have been decided or are being decided both under EC and US law. By the end of the course, students should be able to: consult the sources of EC competition law; identify and understand legal issues arising from EC competition law; and critically evaluate advantages and drawbacks of the policy and the conceptualisms of EC competition law, contrasting it with US antitrust law.",

    "description": "This seminar provides a comprehensive introduction to the theory, doctrine, and practice of patent claim construction. Claim construction\u2014the process of interpreting the claims at the end of the patent that define the patent's scope\u2014is the most important issue in patent litigation. It is a threshold step to virtually every issue in a patent case, including invalidity and infringement. Claims also must be construed by a variety of actors outside of litigation: patent examiners, competitors, researchers, and the patentees themselves. A good understanding of claim construction is thus crucial to being a successful patent practitioner, whether one is a litigator, prosecutor, or transactional lawyer. In addition to readings and discussions, the seminar will include a practical component tracking the claim construction process under the patent local rules used by many district courts. Assessment will be primarily based on the work product generated as part of this claim construction simulation, as well as a paper addressing a significant policy issue related to claim construction. Prerequisite: Patent Law completed or taken concurrently; or permission of instructor.\n\nCredit Hours\nTwo credit hours.",

We will discuss the legal and business considerations that go into the formation of funds, paying close attention to the negotiations between investment advisers and the investors in their funds. Relatedly, we will examine the investment strategies of different investment funds, through leveraged buyouts, equity investments, and more sophisticated trades in derivatives. We will develop a familiarity with the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, which are the key legal regulations governing these funds, as well as with the most current scholarly debates in this field.

Students will be required to attend class on most Mondays during the Fall semester from 7:35 - 9:25 p.m. (2) Students will be required to compete in the Chicago-Kent intramural Giles Rich Moot Court Competition, submitting an appellate brief and presenting an oral argument on a Saturday afternoon in January. The problem used for the intramural competition will consist of the Giles Rich Moot Court Problem. Such problems frequently involve patent law and occasionally trademark or trade secret law. Why take this course? This course will teach you appellate advocacy, both with respect to how to identify the issues and write a convincing appellate brief and how to prepare for, and present, a winning oral argument. Top students in the class will be invited (but not required) to represent the school in the Giles Rich Moot Court Competition. Chicago-Kent students taking this course last year placed second in the Midwest Regional Competition and advanced to the National Competition in Washington, D.C.",

This course illuminates the role economic theory and, more broadly, economic thinking can play in informing and improving environmental policy. Economics is central to understanding why environmental problems arise and how and why to address them. An understanding of markets -- why they work, when they fail, and what lessons they offer for the design of environmental policies and the management of natural resources -- is central to an understanding of environmental issues. But even before we start thinking about how markets work, it is useful to begin with a more basic question: What is environmental economics? The historical evolution and current developments of market-based mechanisms to address environmental issues will be analyzed. Lessons from environmental markets for acid rain and domestic and international greenhouse gas emissions will be discussed at length. Other environmental markets (smog, renewable energy, water, sustainability indices, and biodiversity) will also be covered.",

In this respect, technological innovations have begun to contribute creative solutions to the many problems that healthcare delivery systems face with access to care, affordability of care, and consistent quality of care. This course focuses on how the management of technology and innovation and business and strategy principles can converge to understand the trends, problems, and potential solutions to the American healthcare delivery system and to other systems around the world. The course aims to acquaint the student with the issues and potential solutions of managing the healthcare delivery system. The healthcare sector has unique characteristics as both a social and business enterprise where private and public organizations and enormous resources are involved.

Students will interview clients, represent clients in meetings with corporations and government officials, and represent clients in court.

The course includes an examination of the public policies and economic considerations underlying trademark law, as well as all the basic issues (such as the prerequisites to trademark protection, the registration process, the grounds for excluding signs from protection or registration, the scope of trademark rights, restraining the distribution of imitation and counterfeit goods, and remedies available in trademark litigation). The course will also cover protection available under the general rubric of unfair competition law (including prohibitions on false advertising), as well as publicity rights afforded by state laws. In addition to these basic issues, the course will address issues of current interest, such as: protection of non-traditional subject matter such as product designs or colors; conflicts between trademark protection of non-traditional subject matter and the copyright or patent laws; protection of trademark rights against dilution, and the conflicts with free expression that this and other protection might precipitate; licensing of trademark rights; and reconciling the rights of competing users of trademark terms. Throughout, the course will address the application of trademark principles in new as well as traditional media, and will consider the problems raised by online use of trademarks (in such contexts as metatagging, hyperlinking, sale of keywords, domain name warehousing, and cybersquatting).",

BIM is currently recognized as consolidating the basis for a range of functions including drawing, modeling, document management, clash detection, interdisciplinary coordination, estimating, scheduling, constructability review, production modularization, fabrication protocols, and for the analysis of myriad physical and proscriptive demands such as energy consumption, daylighting, code compliance, egress, circulation, and operation scenarios. The breadth of information embedded in a BIM model will require the emergence of facilitating professionals to an extent previously unknown in the practice and the industry. This course explores the state of the profession and the anticipated ramifications. Undergraduate students must be in their fifth year of study.",

(The Capstone Experience requirement may also be satisfied by participation in the Intellectual Property Law \u00bf Patent Clinic, or the completion of an Intellectual Property Externship). The course may be taken only by J.D. students enrolled in the Intellectual Property Certificate Program. It is intended to be taken in the last year of legal studies. This is a problem-solving course that will bring together learning from different intellectual property courses and from non-intellectual property courses, bringing home the inter-relationships between different bodies of law and asking students to apply that knowledge to a concrete problem faced by a fictional client. The course will be taught by several faculty members. During some class meetings, the class will meet as a group. Between these \"team\" meetings, the class will break into smaller groups (of approximately 8-12 students). These smaller groups will work with teams of two faculty in researching and discussing particular parts of the overall problem, will make oral reports to other members of the small group, and after the small group decides on the appropriate strategy will make oral and brief written reports to the entire class. The entire class will then discuss how best to advise the client to proceed and how best to effectuate the social and commercial objectives of the client. The course is intended to allow students to develop an appreciation of the contexts in which intellectual property problems arise, how to apply knowledge developed in intellectual property and other courses to a concrete problem, the considerations (legal and non-legal) that guide how lawyers approach those problems, and the real-life dynamics that affect the practice of intellectual property law. The class will be graded on a pass/fail basis, based upon performance in class (both when the entire class is present and in small groups) and based upon oral and written presentations.",

Students will receive a total of six credit hours and will receive one grade for the entire six credits. Pass/fail is not available. The course is designed for students who have a serious interest in litigation and wish to be trial lawyers. The goal is that the students receive a clear mastery of the rules of Evidence at the same time learning to master the practical application of those rules in the courtroom. You will be applying the rules of evidence as they are discussed each week in class in your Trial Advocacy sections that same week. The Evidence component will be taught by Justice Erickson, and the Trial Advocacy 1 sections will be taught by three experienced trial lawyers. The course will be limited to twenty-four students for the Evidence portion; students will be assigned, in groups of eight, to one of the Trial Advocacy sections. There will be an Evidence final, a midterm bench trial, and a final jury trial. We believe this integrated hands-on approach will provide each student with a superior knowledge of the rules of evidence as well as the application of those rules.",

Yet, from the earliest days of computerization, women have played a major role in computing's history. These stories have often been submerged, and historians have only recently begun to write them back into the main narrative of the history of computing. Today, this is changing what we think we know about technology's past and how we see our own interactions with it. In this course, students will look at the history of computing through the eyes of women pioneers -- some famous, some ordinary -- and discuss why we haven't heard very much about this history until now. The class will help you better understand why gender, sexuality, and race play an important role in where computing has been and where it is going and, even more importantly, how technological change is interdependent with social categories.",

' 1983 and Bivens actions, whereby state, local and federal officials, as well as local governments, may be held liable in damages when they violate peoples' constitutional rights. Constitutional torts is a subject that is fascinating at both a theoretical and practical level. It raises deep issues of federalism and justice as well as real-world problems of how to make governments accountable to their citizens without undermining their effectiveness. Thousands of constitutional torts cases are filed annually, and they generate considerable controversy, e.g., Rodney King filed a section 1983 damages action against Los Angeles and certain of its police officers. Those who should take this seminar include persons who expect to do federal litigation of any kind, as well as any students who hope to clerk for federal or state judges or work for state and local governments. Not only does the seminar deal with constitutional law but it also addresses federal courts issues, damages and injunctive relief and attorney's fees, among other important subjects.",

    "description": "The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) was enacted a generation ago primarily as a tool for criminal prosecutors to use against organized crime. Its civil provisions were added to the legislation as an afterthought and remained largely dormant for a decade. How-ever, since the early 1980's, civil RICO has become a widely used - many contend overused-tool in the arsenal of the sophisticated commercial litigator. Used effectively, civil RICO's threat of triple damages, attorney's fees, and the stigma of being labeled a racketeer can bludgeon the opposition into early settlement of cases that otherwise would linger in state courts for years. This seminar will examine the history of civil RICO, and how the federal courts have both facilitated and circumscribed its vast expansion into general commercial litigation. An understanding of civil RICO can significantly affect the analysis a lawyer applies to many commercial / business cases.",

Fundamentals of power electronic components (Inverters, DC-DC Converters, and Chargers), electric motors and energy storage systems will be presented in the context of EV powertrains. An introduction to EV/HEV operating strategies, battery chargers and controls will also be discussed.\n\nUsing a combination of power electronic simulations, finite element analysis, hands-on lab experiments and vehicle benchmarking reports, powertrain configurations of popular EV and HEV powertrain components will be analyzed. State of the art, challenges and future trends will be discussed. Low voltage and high voltage systems and advanced distribution system architectures of electric and hybrid electric vehicles will be included. Current trends in the vehicular industry, such as 48V automotive systems and more electric aircraft, will be explained.",

Because of the important changes made by the Tax Reform Act of 1986, we devote the second half of the course to the conduit business vehicles- partnerships, S corporations, and limited liability companies. Topics covered include: organizing and setting up the capital structure of the entity; how operations are taxed; transactions between the entity and its owners; taxable or tax-deferred sales or termination of the entity, and exit strategies for the owners; and the choice of entity for various business purposes.",

    "description": "Experiment in Architecture If you are currently enrolled in high school and looking to the future, you may be interested in IIT\u2019s summer architecture program: Experiment in Architecture. This two-week program is designed to introduce high school students to the profession of architecture. Students will tour the city of Chicago, complete a series of design projects, and attend lectures by IIT faculty. The program is intended to inform students about the study and practice of architecture, and will assist participants in making an informed decision about pursuing an architectural education and career. All individuals interested in pursuing a career in the design and building professions are encouraged to attend. Experiment in Architecture is held on Illinois\nInstitute of Technology\u2019s historic Main Campus, offering unique access to the largest collection of Mies van der Rohe buildings anywhere. Teachers and students take advantage of Chicago as a dynamic laboratory of architectural speculation and discovery. Since enrollment is limited to 30 students, students can expect individual attention from their studio instructors. The program includes field trips to Chicago's architectural landmarks and landscape architectural offices, instruction in freehand sketching with an emphasis on interpreting and visualizing the world around us, studio classes with an emphasis on design through two-dimensional (2-D) representations and three-dimensional (3-D) constructions, and a session on developing and focusing career plans. The program concludes with an exhibition of student work and a reception for students and their families. The work is rigorous and students will need to respond with enthusiasm and maturity. Each day includes a demanding schedule of projects. No prior expertise in drawing or model making is required.Participants who complete the program are awarded certificates. Teachers keep records of performance and may write letters of recommendation as requested. The drawings and models that students produce can be used in application portfolios for college-level architecture programs\n8.

This class examines privacy as protected by statute B through a patchwork of privacy acts B and the concomitant freedom of information requirements of a democratic government, as developed through tort doctrine in the courts, and as articulated through the Constitution of the United States and those of the various states. All aspects of privacy are considered, including wiretapping, government-required personal and business information, personal, family, and reproductive autonomy, the \"right to be let alone,\" and the right of publicity.",

The early advocates of women's rights argued in court cases for equality; this theme is also developed in Zora Neale Hurston's novel, Their Eyes Were Watching God. The Supreme Court case focusing on maternity leave raised the question whether women should be arguing for equality or difference; Toni Morrison's novel The Bluest Eye asks a similar question. Catharine MacKinnon and Carol Gilligan gave the debate a slightly different turn, with MacKinnon focusing on the need to rectify an existing power imbalance and Gilligan emphasizing an appreciation of difference. Both these approaches intersect in Gloria Naylor's The Women of Brewster Place and Cristina Garcia's Dreaming in Cuban. The course will require attendance, participation, four ungraded writing assignments (1-2 pages), and a take-home final exam.",

The course pays particular attention to the role of the judiciary in shaping the EU's legal order. The European Court of Justice developed the fundamental notions of direct effect and supremacy of European law. Those notions, through which rights are created for European citizens, are examined, and the course subsequently turns to how those rights can be enforced. The area of European Trade Law is then chosen as a 'test case' to analyse the legal, political and social developments of the European system. In particular, the provisions on free movements, competition, and state aids are thoroughly analysed with reference to the case law of the European Court of Justice and to relevant secondary legislation. This part of the course, by focusing also on specific issues such as the tension between market forces and values (public health, European culture, and social prerogatives), is not confined to legal themes only but indirectly examines the role of the EU and the values and polices upon which the European constitutional architecture is founded. Therefore, although the course is not a comparative one, a discussion on the US and EU institutional and judicial system is warmly welcome in each lecture. Three credit hours.",

In the United States, for example, millions of people successfully protested the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) on January 18, 2012, a day on which over 115,000 websites\u2014including Wikipedia and Google\u2014blacked out their sites. Despite the widespread popular belief in Internet freedom, the contours of the freedom remain undefined. While tied to the freedom of speech and of the press, the freedom of the Internet may encompass several sui generis protections or concerns, such as protections for its structure that allows an open platform on a non-discriminatory basis (e.g., Net neutrality) and for its governance under a multi-stakeholder, non-governmental approach.

As such, this course seeks to highlight the salience of race in society and everyday life. It focuses on systems of racial subordination, the creation and transformation of racial categories, and the social and psychological development of racial identities. In doing so, the course also constitutes a broad historical survey of major racial groupings in America, delving into the nuances of identity, classification, and subordination for each.

The course takes a particular interest in the actors involved in IP law and policy-making and in the design of alternative decision-making processes, in which IP law and policy are shaped and enforced (political, judicial and administrative processes). The goal is to provide a better understanding of how the dynamic of actor participation influences substantive outcomes and the scope of IP rights and obligations. Among the themes to be discussed are: digital copyright and the responsibility of Internet Intermediaries for copyright enforcement; the changing role of collecting societies; copyright exceptions and limitations; and the position of the digital consumer.

We will also examine the challenges that are faced in creating and operating social enterprises in different parts of the world. The course includes guest lectures by social entrepreneurs working in different areas (such as health, education, and environment).

    "description": "Microsoft Word 2010 is a powerful and popular program, yet most people use only a fraction of its features. In this course, you'll learn Microsoft Word's more advanced features, which can make writing easier, faster, and more fun. You'll improve your creativity and efficiency at the same time!\n\nIn the first part of the course, you'll learn how to perform a mail merge, and we'll explore shortcuts, styles, and templates. Shortcut keys and macros let you type repetitive words and phrases quickly and accurately at the touch of a button. Styles let you save text formatting. Templates let you create documents that contain predefined formatting and text, making it a snap to create documents that look right every time.\n\nIn the second part of the course, we'll cover how to use Word as a simple desktop publishing program to create signs, flyers, menus, brochures, and even newsletters. You'll learn how to insert different types of graphics in a document including digital photographs from your own camera, clip art images provided by Microsoft, and different types of charts such as bar, line, or pie charts.\n\nNext, you'll find out how to wrap text around graphic images and divide a page into columns and text boxes. Both columns and text boxes give you different ways to display text beyond the traditional appearance of text that fills an entire page.\n\nFinally, in the last part of this course, you'll learn about printing labels, making form letters, and creating an index, table of contents, and list of figures automatically. If you need to create long documents, you'll appreciate Word's ability to keep track of page numbers for your chapter headings or index entries.\n\nWhether you need to produce a short letter, flyer, report, or book-length manuscript, this course will teach you how to get the most out of Microsoft Word 2010!\n\n2.400 Continuing Education Units\n\n\nSyllabus Available\n\nLevels: Continuing Education\n\nSchedule Types: Short Course Online (CE only)\n\n\nContinuing Educ Prof Dev Department",

First, law and legal disputes are increasingly becoming more global, so that knowledge of other legal systems with different procedural and doctrinal structures, especially those based on the European civil law tradition rather than the Anglo-American common law tradition, as well as law promulgated by international organizations such as the European Court of Human Rights, is becoming increasingly important to everyday legal practice. Second, studying how other legal systems deal with various substantive and procedural issues can provide useful insights for how those issues might be better dealt with in our legal system. The premise of this course is that the benefits of studying comparative law can be best obtained by focusing on a specific area of law, which however encompasses issues and doctrines that are fundamental to all of law. Tort law is such an area.",

This is especially true in respect to marriage and child rearing, as we see in the current debates over same-sex marriage, but it is also found in the attitudes of states that fail to protect against public and private employment discrimination, and in the federal government\u00bfs \u00bfDon\u00bft Ask/Don\u00bft Tell\u00bf policy to keep openly gay persons from serving in the military. This course/seminar will explore the possibility of finding a legal, philosophical or political framework for approaching LGBT issues by critically looking at various conceptions of homosexuality and society\u00bfs purported justifications for affecting this behavior, against its broader concerns for guaranteeing social liberty and human equality. It will then apply this understanding to the interaction between gays and the criminal justice system; discrimination in public employment (including military service) and private employment; first amendment issues posed by gay teachers in public schools and universities; the legal problems faced in establishing same-sex relationships (especially\nmarriage) in Massachusetts and elsewhere; and the legal problems gay people confront in matters pertaining to child custody and visitation rights. Central to the course will be locating possible interpretations for the Supreme Court\u00bfs 2003 interpretation in Lawrence v. Texas, and its 1996 decision in Romer v. Texas. This particular area of the law is really several areas as they relate to gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgendered people. LGBT have been a kind of exception to the way the law traditionally operates, and this exception cannot usually be made sense of in terms of traditional legal thinking. For this reason the course will engage a certain degree of theoretical abstraction to undersand, clarify and hopefuly improve the law in these areas.",

This course introduces students to historical and contemporary issues in the history of technology to explain how our national and global work forces are shaped by digital, electronic technology. We will look at everything from World War II electronic codebreaking to present-day struggles over net neutrality. We will also look at the \"hidden labor\" behind our digital technologies, from hardware's origins in African mines and Chinese factories to the strenuous manual and psychological labor hidden in the back-ends of many of our favorite online services. Throughout, students will learn how seemingly unrelated changes share a common history. The course will include several guest lecturers from academia and industry.

    "description": "Experiment in Landscape Architecture Students will tour the city of Chicago, complete a series of design projects, and attend lectures by IIT faculty. The program is intended to introduce students to the profession of landscape architecture - a rich and diverse field that incorporates design, environmental ethics, sustainability, sciences, and the arts. Landscape Architecture is projected by the National Bureau of Labor Standards to continue to be a growth profession over the next decade and employment opportunities are expected to be strong and competitive. If you are interested in pursuing a career in the design, construction, or sustainability professions, you are\nencouraged to apply. Experiment in Landscape Architecture welcomes you to IIT Chicago's world-renowned \"campus in a park\" designed by the architect, Mies van der Rohe, with the landscape architect, Alfred Caldwell. Instructors and students take advantage of Chicago as a dynamic laboratory of landscape architecture discovery and speculation.\nThe program includes field trips to Chicago's architectural landmarks and landscape architectural offices, instruction in freehand sketching with an emphasis on interpreting and visualizing the world around us, studio classes with an emphasis on design through two-dimensional (2-D) representations and three-dimensional (3-D) constructions, and a session on developing and focusing career plans. The program concludes with an exhibition of student work and a reception for students and their families. The work is rigorous and students will need to respond with enthusiasm and maturity. Each day includes a demanding schedule of projects. No prior expertise in drawing or model making is required.\nParticipants who complete the program are awarded certificates. Teachers keep records of performance and may write letters of recommendation as requested.

It poses a significant challenge to traditional ways of thinking about law, questioning some of the basic premises of what constitutes justice and equality in a democracy. This course examines the main tenets, methodologies, and controversies in this body of literature including the meaning of equality, the intersection of race and law, the public/private divide, concepts of objectivity and neutrality, and how law reproduces hierarchies while also having the ability to participate in significant social change. We will also analyze debates regarding sex work, domestic violence, reproductive rights, the nature of the workplace, and concepts of the family. The goal of the course is to think broadly and critically regarding the interaction of law, society, and gender while exploring the potential and limitations of our legal system.",

    "description": "This course deals with the important subject of constitutional torts, specifically 42 U.S.C. 1983 and Bivens actions, whereby state, local and federal officials, as well as local governments, may be held liable in damages when they violate peoples' constitutional rights. Constitutional torts is a subject that is fascinating at both a theoretical and practical level. It raises deep issues of federalism and justice as well as real-world problems of how to make governments accountable to their citizens without undermining their effectiveness. Thousands of constitutional torts cases are filed annually, and they generate considerable controversy, e.g., Rodney King filed a section 1983 damages action against Los Angeles and certain of its police officers. Those who should take this course include persons who expect to do federal litigation of any kind, as well as any students who hope to clerk for federal or state judges or work for state and local governments. Not only does the course deal with constitutional law but it also addresses federal courts issues, damages and injunctive relief and attorney's fees, among other important subjects.",

    "description": "This course is an introduction to a rapidly-expanding field in international commercial law. An increasing percentage of all international business contracts contain a clause for binding arbitration in cases of dispute. The reason is simple: In June 1958, the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards was signed and has now been adopted by over 100 countries, including all the major commercial countries. This Convention ensures that an arbitral award, rendered anywhere in the world, will be enforced in the courts of the signatory countries. Judgments of courts do not receive this treatment: court awards are very difficult to enforce in other countries. Students will gain a working knowledge of the various international treaties which provide the structure of international commercial arbitration. The course will explore the ways in which arbitrations can be structured: either ad hoc or under the umbrella of an international organization. The course will examine several umbrella organizations and their \"Rules,\" including The American Arbitration Association, the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC \u00bf Paris), The London Court of International Arbitration, UNCITRAL (United Nations Commission on International Trade Law), the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, and UNCITRAL's Convention for the International Sale of Goods. Topics to be covered include: under each regime and each set of rules, how does an arbitration panel obtain jurisdiction, how are the arbitrators chosen, what is the process, the rules and the costs, where does the arbitration take place, which language is used, how is evidence obtained and admitted, etc. No prerequisites.",

This course employs a hands-on approach. Students will (1) learn about and work with the emerging technology, (2) focus in detail on a self-selected area of law, hopefully working with a faculty adviser, and (3) gain a deeper, practical understanding of the nature of law and legal reasoning, through reflective engagement in the process of attempting to formally model legal knowledge and legal reasoning the selected area of law. Each student will use a provided, easy-to-use program to develop, through a structured series of exercises, his or her own legal expert system of the selected area of law. No computer programming expertise is assumed or required. The grade in the course will be based on the exercise, the completed expert system, and final report which critically describes and assesses the assumptions, methodology, content and limitations of the expert system.",

This course will remedy this oversight by examining the role of the judge from a variety of perspectives. To explore the role of the judge, we will consider a number of questions, including the following: How do judges describe their role when they write or speak about it? How do empirical studies describe what judges do when social scientists and political scientists examine judges' verdicts or demographic characteristics? How is the judge's role portrayed in popular culture, including newspapers, movies, and television shows? This course will examine the different expectations that we have of judges. We also will consider what characteristics make for a good judge and what tools judges think they need in order to perform their job more effectively. Finally, we will look at judges in other countries to see how they perform their job and how they are regarded to see if judicial practices in other countries suggest any reforms that we might try in our own country.\n\nCredit Hours\nThree credit hours.",

    "description": "This seminar is a unique multi-school class taught by weekly live lecture from St John\u2019s Law School in New York and simultaneously telecast to several other participating institutions nationwide, including Chicago-Kent. The seminar is offered under the auspices of the American College of Bankruptcy. The lectures are given by leading bankruptcy judges, practitioners and academics, and satellite classrooms will be equipped with live question-and-answer capability. Professor Walters will host the Chicago-Kent classroom, meaning he will contribute to the curriculum and be responsible for supervising and evaluating your seminar papers. He will be joined for Spring 2016 by the Honorable Judge Timothy A. Barnes of the US Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Because of the need to synchronize with other participating law schools, the class will meet on Tuesdays from 5.30-7.30pm CT, commencing Tuesday January 20, 2016, for the duration of the Spring semester. There are no prerequisites for the class, and while familiarity with basic U.S. bankruptcy law is useful, there will be an opportunity to study or review U.S. business bankruptcy law at an introductory level. The seminar offers an introduction to some of the jurisdictional problems that arise when international corporations become insolvent. International corporations typically have assets and subsidiaries in multiple jurisdictions. When financial distress occurs, a troubled corporation and its subsidiaries may therefore file for bankruptcy in several different jurisdictions with significantly different bankruptcy procedures. It is therefore essential that modern bankruptcy lawyers have at least a basic understanding of the distinctive features of foreign bankruptcy regimes. Additionally, even if a corporation and its subsidiaries file for bankruptcy in a single jurisdiction, the courts in that jurisdiction will often need the assistance of courts in foreign jurisdictions in order to protect the corporation's assets and consummate a successful reorganization or liquidation. It is therefore important for modern bankruptcy lawyers to understand the scope for international cooperation between courts and practitioners and the international legal instruments that seek to foster such cooperation. The first half of this class identifies the basic contours of the world's major bankruptcy regimes, including the laws of the United States, United Kingdom, China, Japan, Canada, and of various Latin American and Western European countries. During the second half, we study the major legal frameworks for international assistance and cooperation in cross-border bankruptcies (Chapter 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the European Union\u2019s Insolvency Regulation). We also discuss the opportunities for foreign nationals to use U.S. Bankruptcy Law (particularly Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code) to pursue a reorganization in the United States. Instructors: Each class will be taught by one or more visiting instructors. Technical Aspects: The course will originate at St John\u2019s Law School and be telecast to the other participating. Students at the other schools will be able to see and hear the instructor and ask questions in real time. Students are evaluated and graded by professors at their home institutions. At Chicago-Kent, students will work on a substantial research paper and a series of short (2\u20133 page) analysis papers.\n\nCredit Hours\nTwo credit hours.",

Specialized research and design within a wide range of architectural problems include site selection, consideration of architectural context and environmental impacts, development of user function and space programs, and architectural planning and design. Aesthetic and visual aspects and the intellectual foundations of the problem are carefully considered, as well as the technical aspects in the selection and integration of structural and environmental systems. Successful Masters project proposals will be grouped into \"Areas of Focus\" studios. After final acceptance of the presentation materials by the faculty advisor and the \"Area of Focus\" teaching faculty, the text, reductions of the drawings, and model photographs are bound together, which are deposited in the GRC and the University's library.",

The risk measurement aspect of the course begins with the development of the Value-at-Risk (VaR) methodology for financial instruments traded in open markets including equities, bonds, foreign currencies and their derivatives. The course develops analytic VaR models for instruments with non-linear payoffs and non-normal distributions and it also develops simulation methodologies for risk analysis. Statistical tools in volatility forecasting, tail events, and expected shortfall are introduced as appropriate. The emphasis of the course is on market risk, but in addition to the traditional analysis of trading rooms, the course also considers regulatory and compliance risk, corporate risk and risk analysis for investment managers.",

The seminar addresses the question of whether there is agreement as to fundamental human rights. Recent developments and tensions in the field of human rights particularly since the increase membership of counties from the third world and socialist block countries are investigated. This is highlighted by focusing on the later two covenants of the United Nations, particularly the Covenant on Social, Economic and Cultural Rights, which enlarges the scope of human rights to include welfare, cultural, and economic rights.

It is offered as part of the Program in Environmental and Energy Law but is open to all students. After a brief introduction to scientific concepts of energy and the history of energy technology, the course will survey the major sources of energy. The traditional sources have been oil, natural gas and coal converted to consumer products such as electricity and gasoline. Newer sources include nuclear and solar energy. Each source and delivery system has its own network of property rules and contract relationships. National energy policy will be reviewed and the impact of interregional competition on the regulation of energy will be studied, as will constitutional and economic concepts affecting the pricing of energy. Particular emphasis will be placed on energy issues in environmental law.",

We will learn how to resolve structural heterogeneity through schema matching and mapping.

Furthermore, we will cover the data-warehouse paradigm including the Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) process, the data cube model and its relational representations (such as snowflake and star schema), and efficient processing of analytical queries. This will be contrasted with Big Data analytics approaches that (besides other differences) significantly reduce the upfront cost of analytics. When feeding data through complex processing pipelines such as data exchange transformations or ETL workflows, it is easy to lose track of the origin of data. Therefore, in the last part of the course we cover techniques for representing and keeping track of the origin and creation process of data (its provenance).\n\nThe course emphasizespractical skills through a series of homework assignments that help students develop a strong background in data integration systems and techniques. At the same time, it also addresses the underlying formalisms. For example, we will discuss the logic based languages used for schema mapping and the dimensional data model as well as their practical application (e.g., developing an ETL workflow with rapid miner and creating a mapping between two example schemata).

The course will consider strategies to leverage limited resources for maximum effect. The course will also cover small organization and group behavior, performance, leadership, and motivation in small business settings and will focus on the owner/manager as the principal success factor in the context of a small organization. Emphasis is placed on the circumstances and opportunities of the professional practice of architecture: practice as profession, process, organization, business, and evolving models of practice are covered. The course also provides a series of concepts, frameworks, and heuristics that enable the entrepreneur to anticipate and deal with the challenges that accompany growth of an existing business. Cases, exercises, lectures, and speakers are used to focus on choosing opportunities, allocating resources, motivating employees, and maintaining control while not stifling innovation. A key component of the course is how to sustain entrepreneurial thinking in mid-sized ventures as they continue to grow.",

The introduction of BIM (Building Information Modeling) is an advance in project delivery tools which should be viewed as a multi-dimensional expansion of the mechanisms of management and accommodation of an ever-broadening range of participants in the organization of a project, allowing the development of a new delivery protocol, IBPD (Integrated Building Project Delivery). BIM is currently recognized as consolidating the basis for a range of functions including drawing, modeling, document management, clash detection, interdisciplinary coordination, estimating, scheduling, constructability review, production modularization, fabrication protocols, and for the analysis of myriad physical and proscriptive demands such as energy consumption, daylighting, code compliance, egress, circulation, and operation scenarios. The breadth of information embedded in a BIM model will require the emergence of facilitating professionals to an extent previously unknown in the practice and the industry. This course explores the state of the profession and the anticipated ramifications.",

What role do visual media, particularly films and documentaries, play in the process of creating and understanding our shared past? Can film be a force for uncovering and popularizing \"hidden\" histories that upset our assumptions about the past? This course takes a novel approach to less well-known chapters in history by looking at how films and documentaries can be tools for disseminating historical knowledge and how they can also be activist interventions in how we understand the past and its relationship to the society we live in today. Throughout the course, we will watch films and documentaries that try to answer the questions posed above, and we will read historical accounts of the events they convey. Students will learn how to write a short history from primary documents and then transfer it to an audio or a visual medium. This will result in 2 projects: a short podcast and a short documentary film on a historical topic.",

Historically, MNCs targeted the customers at the top of the pyramid in these countries because their business models worked well for them. But as these bottom-of-the-pyramid markets become more economically profitable, MNCs need to make a serious attempt to evaluate and target them. In order to successfully compete for customers in these markets, MNCs should design innovative business models that could represent a radical departure from the way they do business in more advanced countries. This course is about such business model innovation. Students will learn tools of international market opportunity analysis, foreign market entry strategies, the social, economical, and ethical factors affecting decisions to serve low income customers, the stringent requirements of the customers at the bottom of the pyramid, and business models to profitably serve these customers.",

Studios work on sites within Chicago, explore urban areas around the globe, and/or focus on hypothetical or technological challenges that shape the built environment. Students design structural and material systems that recognize issues of ecology as well as the broader, integrated concerns of climate, energy and natural resource use, and sustainability. Uniting the diverse strands of urban place making, economic diversity, social equity and environmental stewardship, Advanced Studios promote the design of places that reflect the values of their inhabitants, and create a lasting sense of community with meaningful identity. The studios are formed in thematic clusters that complement each other or serve as dialectical opposites. Each studio explores a variety of techniques from parametric design, digital fabrication, model making, and advanced geospatial software to cultural and theoretical explorations. Students will be able to select from a variety of studio topics. The vertical studio integrates advanced BArch, MArch, MS, and PHD students. Open only to Architecture majors.",

Both courses are taught with extensive use of simulation exercises. Business Entity Formation provides an opportunity for students to form various types of business entities including partnerships, limited liability companies and corporations. In Business Entity Transactions, students implement various business transactions such as employment and consulting agreements, shareholder agreements and agreements in connection with the purchase and sale of a business. In both courses, the students apply the legal doctrine learned in Business Organizations and other courses to a series of progressively more sophisticated simulation exercises and prepare the documents necessary, in Business Entity Formation, to create and organize the entities; and in the case of Business Entity transactions, to implement the various business transactions required by the exercises. In both courses the students utilize information gathering, planning, counseling and negotiating skills in the development of the documents.",

    "description": "Many people submit to the law simply because they believe that the institutions administering it are just. But what if a law itself is unjust? The duty to obey law presupposes that laws are both consistent and just: because they sometime aren't, difficult cases arise in which appeals to a higher political morality become necessary if justice is to be served. But what is this higher political morality and what is its connection to the institutions we rely upon to do justice and protect our human rights as well as to the laws that are actually produced? Is this higher political morality the morality of our society or something broader? And, if it is something broader, how do we discover what it is? In this course, we will attempt to answer these and other questions by considering the relationship between legal and political philosophy, showing how the former is incomplete without the latter. Taking the problem of how to solve difficult cases as our point of departure, we will look at the inherent incompleteness of conventional theories of law with the idea of developing a meta-theory that would enable judges to decide difficult cases by drawing upon the best available theory of politics appropriate to the case's level of abstraction. By so doing, it is hoped that we will be able to produce resolutions for some kinds of controversial cases and open doors to the way we should think about others. It is also hoped that the course will provide an avenue for a broad critique of the way legal and political institutions operate including the way law schools educate and judges actually decide cases.",

The principle thrust of the law is to limit the methods of warfare (e.g., by banning certain weapons) and to protect people not engaged in combat, such as POWs, the sick and wounded, and civilians. This class will focus on the most important sources of IHL, which include the 1949 Geneva Conventions and their two protocols, the 1907 Hague Regulations, and various other rules contributing to the customary international law of armed conflict. Most of IHL applies only to international armed conflict. The class will also consider the special challenges raised by the application and adaptation of these rules to internal armed conflict and to the so-called \u00bfwar on terror.\u00bf Finally, the class will briefly consider the use of international tribunals as an enforcement mechanism.

Every item you purchase or use in your everyday life was delivered by a truck or other mode of transportation (rail, ocean, air). America could not function without the transportation industry. There have been a series of deregulations affecting the transportation industry over the years. After September 11, 2001, cargo security became an important issue for the United States, which lead to many new laws and regulations. This constant roller coaster of deregulation and regulation makes being a transportation attorney very exciting. This course will briefly describe the different modes of transportation and the regulating bodies for each. We will be focusing our class on the surface modes of transportation, namely trucking and rail. The main topics discussed will be contracts, tariffs, liability for loss and damage to cargo, tort liability of shippers, carriers, customers, and brokers during and after the transportation of freight and a comprehensive understanding of insurance and the various policy forms that exist.",

Lawyers representing nonprofits and businesses with a social purpose alike (as both in-house and outside counsel) play an increasingly important role as legal, business, and strategic advisers who not only protect the interests of the organization, but who also creatively contribute as productive members of business, operations, and program teams. This course will explore the roles, responsibilities, and practical considerations these attorneys manage.\n\nThe guidance and tools that lawyers provide their social enterprise clients will be a core focus of the course. The course will also explore emerging areas for social innovation, including new and hybrid organizational structures, innovative financing mechanisms, and considerations unique to charities engaged in increasingly popular cross-sector partnerships - from donor intent to cause marketing to social investment approaches. Taught from the perspective of an in-house attorney for a global charity that works around the world on multiple initiatives with diverse cross-sector partners, this course will introduce students to the most commonly addressed issues and most frequently used tools and approaches for developing, implementing, and assessing new and dynamic social enterprises.\n\nAs an experiential component, the course will allow students to take on the role of a client that has developed a new idea for a social enterprise and to also serve as counsel that provides both practical tools and strategic program guidance to these endeavors. Students will develop the ability to properly assess and advise on legal and business issues, effectively offer guidance, and develop skills in utilizing the most commonly used tools, approaches, and insights necessary to help organizations build sustainable operations and impactful programs.\n\nThis course counts as an elective course toward the Public Interest Law Certificate and the Praxis Certificate.

The practice problems will involve a variety of legal tasks from a hands-on, practical perspective that will require class members to engage in different forms of legal writing and speaking, designed to develop your litigation skills. The class will be jointly taught by two practing attorneys, one who represents plaintiffs in civil rights cases and one who defends police officers and municpailities in such cases. These attorneys have gone head-to-head against each other in multiple police misconduct cases and their experience will bring a unique real-world perspective to the class. Grades will be based on a combination of your written work product, skills practice exercises, and participation in class discussion. There will be a number of written and oral project assignments of different lengths during the semester. These projects are intended to expose you to the litigation process in the specific context of a police misconduct civil rights case, including pleadings, the development of discovery, briefs, and various motions. At some point during the semester, all students will be required to observe a portion of a civil rights trial in the United States District Court.",

Consonants and vowels are briefly reviewed, and practice is assigned based on individual needs. Students will practice pronouncing advanced and academic vocabulary, as well as longer and more complex exchanges and passages. In addition to correctly imitating the pronunciation used in various recordings, students will be asked to produce mini-speeches with self analysis and corrections. Students will also give one longer in-class presentation on an academic topic to show their proficiency in the material covered in the course. Placement in this course is based on placement exam results and/or the successful completion of Pronunciation (IEP 026).\n\n3.000 Continuing Education Units\n\n\n\n0.000 Other hours\n\n\nLevels: Continuing Education\n\nSchedule Types: Lecture\n\n\nEnglish Language Services Department",

    "description": "In 1805 there lived a total of approximately 5.3 million people in the United States B far fewer than the 6 million people who today live in Massachusetts or any of 15 other States of the Union. In 1828 James Fenimore Cooper, an American born commentator on American life, took note of the burgeoning population growth and projected that in one hundred years America's population might reach \"near or quite 100 million.\" Continue Cooper, \"the first impression that strike the mind is the impossibility that 100 million people should consent to live quietly under the same government.\" Today's population, of course, is not only much larger but is far more diverse than Cooper imagined. One of the reasons our country has been able to grow and still remain united, ironically, is that under our federal system much political power is decentralized at the state, local, and other subfederal levels. And that is what this course is about: the decentralization of power. The course explores the conflicts inherent in the allocation of power between the national, state, and local governments. It tries to answer questions like: Why do we still have states? What are the maximal powers that states and local governments have, and should have, to create environments that both shape and reflect their citizens' desires? In answering these and related questions the course will look to both law and political theory. Explored in detail will be many of the constitutional doctrines that define our country's federal structure. Also examined will be vital doctrines concerning local government formation and annexation, statutory and home rule powers, the relationships between local governments (including city : suburb), participation in local government, as well as important issues in taxation and finance.",

The studio investigates the articulation of space, tectonic assembly, and human behavior as critical foundations of the making of the built environment. The studio focuses on developing core drawing, making, thinking, and communication skills via a series of discrete projects that aggregate into a comprehensive body of work. Analytical investigation of the techniques and methods of architectural design and representation are interwoven with an analytical investigation of site, place, inhabitation, and elemental spatial archetypes. The studio is largely comprised of two primary projects (Composite City and Inhabited Archetypes), with specific internal phases and deliverables, structured to operate as a complementary whole. Composite City comprises a series of studies in drawing, modeling and making that dissect the layers, components and phenomena of the built environment, via questions of narrative, memory, space, tectonics, systems and compositions. Inhabited Archetypes comprises a series of spatial explorations that employ the preceding analyses as sites of operation. Four archetypes (bridge, tower, wall, stair) prompt fundamental questions of architectural space (tectonics and inhabitation) and design processes. Working iteratively and comparatively, each archetype will be a medium to investigate issues of structure, skin, thickness, thinness, material, assembly, inhabitation and narrative. The semester culminates with the process of assembling student portfolios.",

    "description": "The design studio focuses on the design and structural engineering of high-volume residential buildings, or \u201chousing.\u201d The design of housing in cities such as Chicago is a story of bold experimentation and innovation, but also contradictions and controversy. Chicago has been at the forefront of developing new types of public and private housing and design strategies to improve and maintain public health since the city\u2019s founding in the mid 19th century. Students are exposed to a variety of housing and hybrid buildings, and undertake research projects in select cities around the world to compare and contrast a variety of issues such as: density, dwelling unit types, mixed use programing, materiality, development models, cultural norms, and relationships between functionality and luxury. The studio is structured around three primary assignments beginning with research and drawing assignments of housing types in Chicago, followed by analyses of dense, urban housing projects in global cities, to the final design project. The studio\u2019s principle concern is giving form, shape, and character to collectively inhabited high-rise buildings, and to the streets and public spaces that surround them. Several lectures, presentations and field trips throughout the semester highlight discernable and meaningful connections between people and places, movement and morphology, natural resources and the artificial fabric of the city. A particular focus is on place-making, environmental stewardship, social equity, and economic vitality of urban neighborhoods. The studio operates as a laboratory in which to explore new possibilities for urban living in Chicago, specifically within a selected neighborhood and project site.",

    "description": "Advanced Studios engage both IIT architecture faculty and a select group of visiting studio professors noted for their outstanding professional experience in contemporary practice. The focus of each studio is strong design experimentation that is implemented in highly resolved, complex architectural design projects. Studios work on sites within Chicago, explore urban areas around the globe, and/or focus on hypothetical or technological challenges that shape the built environment. Students design structural and material systems that recognize issues of ecology as well as the broader, integrated concerns of climate, energy and natural resource use, and sustainability. Uniting the diverse strands of urban place making, economic diversity, social equity and environmental stewardship, Advanced Studios promote the design of places that reflect the values of their inhabitants, and create a lasting sense of community with meaningful identity. The studios are formed in thematic clusters that complement each other or serve as dialectical opposites. Each studio explores a variety of techniques from parametric design, digital fabrication, model making, and advanced geospatial software to cultural and theoretical explorations. Students will be able to select from a variety of studio topics. The vertical studio integrates advanced BArch, MArch, MS, and PHD students. Open only to Architecture majors.",

    "description": "The design studio focuses on the design of urban industrial architecture. Industrial buildings house large number of workers operating complex, high-tech machinery and equipment. Industrial buildings have gradually become a vital part of the architecture of the 21th century. Thanks to the constant advancement of non-polluting micro-technologies, industrial buildings are emerging in the center of service-oriented cities around the globe. The first part of the semester focuses on understanding the typology of industrial buildings through the careful investigation of current workplace issues, historical and contemporary precedents, and an in-depth analysis and documentation of a particular site within a specific neighborhood in the city of Chicago. The second part of the studio focuses on aesthetic qualities of industrial architecture, and design issues related to: building facades and layered skins; proportioning and division of large volumes of enclosed space; harmony of structural and internal spatial elements; orderly placement of people, machinery and equipment; and, systematic arrangement of logistical operations to and from the project site. Emphasis is placed on the environmental sustainability of the building design approach and execution. Special attention is given to material/spatial efficiency, mechanical system selection and envelope design. Students are encouraged to evaluate and provide proof-of-concept data for decisions pertaining to energy use and efficiency, recycling and the reuse of natural resources.",

    "description": "The aim of the design studio is to develop formal solutions which address the complexities of modern metropolis and advance disciplinary knowledge at large. The Advanced Studio program provides the intellectual climate as well as material infrastructure to explore the larger forces that influence the growth of cities. In the contemporary world, developing alternative models of design are necessary to make a transformative impact on the built environment. Design work in Advanced Studios at IIT directly engages real-life challenges and design-based solutions. As they seek to synthesize and impart principles and knowledge, to advance aesthetic and analytical skills, and to creatively expand upon given cultural norms, the Advanced Studios offer students the means to leverage their intuitions and insights to find better ways to enhance the built environment. The studios are formed in thematic clusters that complement each other or serve as dialectical opposites. Each studio explores a variety of techniques from parametric design, digital fabrication, model making, and advanced geospatial software to cultural and theoretical explorations. The vertical studio integrates advanced BArch, MArch, MS, and PHD students. Open only to Architecture majors.",

The course will emphasize segmentation of the market, positioning the marketing mix to meet the needs of the market segment, sustaining an integrated marketing mix over the product life cycle, and organizing the strategic business unit to implement the strategy. In addition to the development of a marketing stategy that positions the product/service to the needs of one or more target markets (segmentation), the execution of a marketing strategy will require a marketing plan that includes the economic and financial analysis of the costs and potential profits of the strategy and an implementation plan, including an organizational structure. This will often be an iterative process to find an optimal combination of costs, pricing, and volume to maximize profits. This course will use readings, simulations, and cases for about half its content. The other half of the course will be a team consulting project for an external client.",

Business students who are interested in trading, analytics, and financial risk management should pay attention to energy markets. In addition, some engineering/science students would like to widen their comfort zone to financial/commodity markets, which may be their future employers. This three-credit course is designed for such business, engineering, and science Master\u2019s students. This course introduces energy markets, discusses trading for speculative, arbitrage, and hedging purposes, and provides a systematic exposition of data-driven analytic models for energy prices and other risk factors. At the end of this semester, students will be able to help research, propose, and implement hedging/trading strategies in energy markets. Beyond reading materials and attending lectures, students will also work on in-class exercises and homework assignments consisting of paper-and-pencil problems and computer programming tasks. Through a term project, students will work on a carefully-designed practical problem, gain hands-on experience of programming for trading and financial risk management, and write a white paper. A white paper in this kind of course serves as an effective marketing tool for job search purposes. The aforementioned in-class exercises and homework assignments will provide various guidance for the term project. The learning objectives of this course is in line with the energy risk professionals (ERP) exam from the Global Association of Risk Professionals (GARP). This course is a self-contained course which will help motivated, hard-working students develop themselves into a financial risk manager, an asset optimizer, a trader, a structuring and pricing analyst, a middle office analyst, a quantitative analyst, a data scientist, a quantitative programmer, etc.\"",

    "description": "The Clinical Rotation (2 credits, graded pass/fail) aims to help first-year students refine their career interests by providing early exposure to diverse areas of law practice. It allows students to rotate through three in-house clinics exposing them to three distinct practice areas and lawyering styles. Students enrolled in the Clinic Rotation will spend four weeks with each of the three practice areas led by an in-house clinical faculty member/attorney. Practice areas include criminal defense, employment/civil litigation, entrepreneurial law, family law, health and disability law, and tax and probate law. During each four-week rotation, students may be given the opportunity to gain exposure to the inner workings of a law practice and they may be exposed to or participate in any of the following: legal and factual research, client interview simulations, document drafting, discovery review, simulations of administrative hearings and negotiations, trial strategy sessions, and observation of court and motion calls. Due to the differences among the practice areas and the nature of the practice of law, student experiences will vary between practice areas and individual rotations.\n\nStudents will be required to put in a total of 112 hours over the course of the semester. This includes weekly attendance for 14 weeks at a two-hour plenary session (28 hours total), which will expose students to various aspects of practice, lawyering ethics, and law offices management. Students will spend their remaining 84 hours (seven hours a week) during the 3 Clinical Rotations working independently, in groups, and in collaboration with the clinical faculty members, including a weekly two-hour group discussion session taught by the clinical professor to whom they have been assigned for the four-week period. The three four-week Clinical Rotations will end after the 13th week of the semester.\n\nThe weekly plenary sessions will meet on Thursdays from 1:55 to 3:45 pm. The weekly group discussion sessions with individual clinical professors will meet either Tuesdays 4:00-5:50pm or Thursdays 4:00-5:50pm (depending on the professor). The remainder of the student's hours (five hours per week) will be scheduled so as not to conflict with the class meeting times for the student's other courses.\n\nStudents enrolled in the Clinic Rotation will be graded on a pass/fail basis and will receive a grade of Pass, Low Pass, or Fail. Attendance at all 14 plenary sessions and all 12 group discussion sessions is mandatory. If a student is absent from one or two plenary sessions or group discussion sessions or a combination of one or two such sessions his or her grade will not be affected; if however, a student is absent from a combination of either three or four such sessions, he or she will receive a grade of LOW PASS; and if a student is absent from a combination of more than four such sessions he or she will receive a grade of FAIL. In addition, if a student does not satisfactorily complete his or her weekly Clinic Rotation assignments he or she will receive a grade of LOW PASS or FAIL.\n\nCredit Hours\nTwo credit hours.",

Critical Race Theory (CRT) begins from the perspective that racism is an everyday, \"normal\" component of American social and political relations, rather than a set of aberrant individual attitudes and behaviors that can be muted by anti-discrimination law. As such, this course seeks to highlight the salience of race in society and everyday life. It focuses on systems of racial subordination, the creation and transformation of racial categories, and the social and psychological development of racial identities. In doing so, the course also constitutes a broad historical survey of major racial groupings in America, delving into the nuances of identity, classification, and subordination for each. Finally, while the course is rooted in law and legal scholarship, it draws significantly from a variety of academic disciplines-including sociology, psychology, history, ethnic studies, and education.\n\nCredit Hours\nTwo credit hours.",

It looks at the way controversial issues of IP law and policy are being handled in Europe (the EU and some of its Member States) and in the US in order to identify similarities and differences and to analyze their causes and their implications in a globalized world. The course takes a particular interest in the actors involved in IP law and policy-making and in the design of alternative decision-making processes, in which IP law and policy are shaped and enforced (political, judicial and administrative processes). The goal is to provide a better understanding of how the dynamic of actor participation influences substantive outcomes and the scope of IP rights and obligations. Among the themes to be discussed are: digital copyright and the responsibility of Internet Intermediaries for copyright enforcement; the changing role of collecting societies; copyright exceptions and limitations; and the position of the digital consumer. The emphasis is on copyright law and institutions, but the course also explores other IP controversies within the area of patent, trademark and unfair competition law.\n\nCredit Hours\nTwo credit hours.",

Students develop an understanding of the long term and intermediate goals of a reliability program and acquire the necessary knowledge and tools to meet these goals. The concepts of both probabilistic and deterministic design are presented, along with the necessary supporting understanding that enables engineers to make design trade-offs that achieve a positive impact on the design process. Strengthening their ability to contribute in a cross functional environment, students gain insight that helps them understand the reliability engineering implications associated with a given design objective, and the customer's expectations associated with the individual product or product platforms that integrate the design. These expectations are transformed into metrics against which the design can be measured. A group project focuses on selecting a system, developing a flexible reliability model, and applying assessment techniques that suggest options for improving the design of the system.

The goal of the course is to help future senior executives understand how firms compete in a global marketplace and society and how they make money by creating sustainable competitive advantage. Essentially, this involves creating an alignment or fit between the organization and trends in the next economy/marketplace, the definition and strategy of the firm, and the firm\u2019s organizational structure. We will refer to this as the business model which both tells the story of the business and analyze the numbers to show that the story can make a profit. The course will emphasize an integrated view of the firm and the connections between and among the various functions and levels of activity in the firm as well as its relationships and interactions with other players including rivals, suppliers, customers, regulators, and the public. Most cases will take the point of view from the top management/CEO of the firm, but it is the behavior of the firm that we are interested in.",

This course explores the history of technology by using gender as a category of analysis. It also looks at how technological objects and tools participate in molding elements of our culture that we may take for granted as logical or timeless. By looking at change over time, we will analyze the different ways technology affects how we live and see ourselves and how gender defines technological priorities.",

We will treat law as reflecting and shaping politics, society, the economy, and culture. We will study not only case law and the specific facts that gave rise to particular court cases, but also how law shapes people\u00bfs identities. Readings will include a wide-range of secondary scholarship and primary documents, including briefs, trial transcripts, and items of popular culture.

This one agency regulates most of the nation's foods, and all of its dietary supplements, pharmaceuticals, biological products, medical devices, cosmetics, and other products. It does so with a variety of legal tools and varying degrees of control over different product types, and yet its actions are guided by just two key goals -- to protect the public health and to help new products get to market -- and a small number of deceptively simple concepts. This course will examine the primary powers of this important agency, how the agency has changed over time in response to crises, business trends, and evolving public policy considerations, and will address some of the key concepts common to all federal regulatory agencies.",

    "description": "The Legal Externship Program is a four-hour pass/fail program that enables a law student to receive academic credit (without pay) for working 16 hours a week in an approved legal placement under the supervision of a designated attorney. The program is unique in that it enables students to gain practical experience and develop their legal skills while at the same time making themselves more marketable to prospective employers. Legal Externship consists primarily of a fieldwork experience under a supervising lawyer, supplemented by individual meetings between the extern and his/her faculty advisor throughout the semester. Externs interested in civil law may select to work in corporations, firms or government agencies, specializing in such diverse legal areas as immigration, tax, commodities, securities, health care, medical malpractice, or general corporate law. Externs in criminal law may choose to work with the States Attorney's Office, Public Defender's Office, or the U.S. Attorney's Office. Some externships offer the opportunity to obtain a 711 license and appear in court. For permission to do an externship or for more information about available externship opportunities, please contact Professor Vivien Gross (vgross@kentlaw.edu).",

    "description": "New technologies offer benefits to society, but they also often pose new threats to health, safety, or the quality of life. The more transformative the technology, the greater the likelihood that calls will come to regulate it. Drones, self-driving cars, many alternative energy sources, and new healthcare procedures are examples, but they do not exhaust the possibilities. Regulation can take various forms, from competition in the marketplace without much government intervention (the Internet), to a-priori government requirements that must be satisfied before a product can be offered for sale (new drugs), to self-certification by manufacturers of compliance with government standards (aircraft and motor vehicles close), to after-the-fact regulation by tort law. Student papers in the seminar will explore the advantages and disadvantages of different combinations of these tools for specific technologies. It is expected that drones and self-driving vehicles will receive particular attention.\n\nCredit Hours\nTwo credit hours.",

Exercises in this course are designed to introduce the students to the basic skills of trial advocacy in a primarily \"learned by doing\" format. Secondly, the course will expose the student to a variety of issues in the context of intellectual property cases. The course will necessarily include substantive intellectual property law as it pertains to the assigned a cases. The case files used in the course have been developed from actual intellectual property cases. In some case files, the actual legal memoranda discussing the substantive law issues presented in those cases have been included for the students benefit. Each student will be required to provide one juror for the final trial in which he or she is the trial attorney. Each student will be graded on the basis of daily performance throughout the course, a preliminary injunction hearing, and the final trial. You will be graded on objective performance; and upon your performance improvement during the course. Students must attend each class session from the class session start to the class session finish, and must be prepared to perform the exercises listed in the syllabus. Students will be expected to both conduct the exercise as counsel and to play the role of witness when called upon to do so. Prerequisite: Evidence and two of the following: Patent Law, Trademarks & Unfair Competition, Copyright Law, Law of Trade Secrets. Pass/fail not available.

With lean thinking comes the identification of waste, which can take many forms including organizational policies and practices which may not provide any value to the customer. The next step is to map the process as it is in its current state so that potential future state improvements are more easily identified and serve as a catalyst toward achieving process perfection. Diagnostic tools are introduced, both qualitative and quantitative in nature, to help reveal the potential of the process.",

    "description": "The practice of law is being transformed by technological innovation and intense economic pressures to deliver more legal services for less. This course will provide students with a grounding in the ethical rules governing the legal profession with a special focus on the challenges presented by these developments in law practice. E-Discovery, electronic communications, and document recognition software are fundamentally altering not only the work that big law firms do but how they price it. Corporate clients are demanding changes to price structures as they grow increasingly unwilling to pay for any lawyer who is not already experienced or whose work can be performed adequately by a computer or a paralegal. Comparably, the commodification of routine legal documents for smaller, less complicated transactions, is allowing non-lawyers to perform many of the services traditionally performed by lawyers. Attorneys serving the market for personal legal services and small businesses need to learn how to provide and explain the unique value that they can provide as lawyers. Meanwhile, legal services agencies that serve low-income people are using technology vastly to increase the number of clients served. These technological innovations and the ways in which they affect the pricing of legal services inevitably affect lawyers' ethical obligations, particularly with regard to marketing, confidentiality and conflicts of interest. This course will draw on regional and national experts to help explain how technological change affects how law firms operate and then help students learn to anticipate next steps in the ethical delivery of legal services. This course fulfills the general graduation requirement that all students must take a course in Professional Responsibility.\n\nCredit Hours\nThree credit hours.",

BME527 is the same class to extend this course to graduate students.\n\nThe Extra Cellular Matrix (ECM) is that which connects cells in tissues and provides much of the organization and support in almost every tissue and or organ system of the body. Thus the aim of this course is to give students insights into ECM biology and its relevance to modern medicine and biomedical (tissue) engineering. A significant portion of working population is suffering from ECM-related maladies, and the focus of research has shifted into creating ECM implants. The ECM implant market is growing rapidly. For instance, the collagen meniscus implant market was reported to be at $308.6 million in 20181. Understanding the implications of the molecular biology of ECM to feed into this research is highly relevant for students considering careers (academic and industry) in life sciences in industry, academia and healthcare.\nExtracellular Matrix (ECM) is a highly complex system in mammalian biology responsible for structural support and functional (biochemical) signals for physiology. Specific amino acid sequences on the various ECM elements are responsible to trigger intra- and extracellular cascades leading to cell division, proliferation, tissue regeneration, wound healing and inflammation. This course will focus on the following key concepts:\na) Gene expression, structure and function of various ECM proteins and complexes and the physiological processes.\nb) Etiology and the molecular progression of diseases caused by abnormalities to ECM proteins.\nc) Mechanobiology of various ECM proteins.\nd) Structure function and mechanical function of ECM interfaces with other tissues (muscle, bone, skin etc.)\ne) Implications for tissue engineering and development of novel biomimetic and biological ECM implants.",

It focuses on recent trends and challenges of the legal industry. Designed to prepare law students for the realities of the practice of law, it will address the economics of the law business, work place communication skills, management quandaries, ethical problems, client service and development fundamentals, and how junior lawyers can be the most valuable to their law firms, corporate law departments, or agencies. The course will use a text on law practice management and additional case studies, court decisions, and articles. The class is highly participatory, with simulations and frequent class discussion and presentations. There may be modeling or papers to be developed during the semester.

Through an examination of major episodes from American history, students will be exposed to central themes of constitutional development: the concept of a written constitution, judicial review, the balance of power between the central government and the states, the problem of slavery and racial equality, free speech, gender equality, and the role of law in shaping cultural norms. Although much of the course is dedicated to analyzing the ways in which the courts, particularly the United States Supreme Court, have interpreted and applied the Constitution, we will also give close attention to the efforts of individuals and groups outside the judiciary to shape the Constitution and define its role in American society.\n\nCredit Hours\nThree credit hours.",

    "description": "This course provides an introduction to the practice and strategy of marketing. Marketing activities are those processes and functions that enable managers and policy-makers to identify and serve the values and needs of a customer given the capacities of the company, activities of competitors, and inherent constraints in the business environment. Marketers typically refer to these concepts as the \"four C's.\" Based on their understanding of the \"four C's,\" students will then learn how to implement strategy by applying the levers of the marketing mix. These elements are known as the four P's (product, price, place/channels of distribution, and promotion). The treatment of marketing constraints and marketing mix will be motivated by essential foundations from economics, sociology, and consumer behavior. Over the course of the semester, students are expected to transition from thinking about these concepts in isolation to a dynamic, integrative framework. This process includes using the marketing strategy framework to assess business and policy problems from a \"multiple objective\" perspective: that is, the student will be asked to think about how marketing activities along with those of competitors and collaborators will affect the profitability, sustainability, social, and ethical standing of the firm. The synthesis of these concepts will be carried out through the use of case studies, problem sets, classroom lectures, discussions, and a field project. There will also be a midterm and final exam. The pedagogical style of the course emphasizes the students' role in applying the concepts discussed in the lectures to the situations at hand. The role of the instructor is to provide tools to structure thinking and to stimulate and facilitate analysis of the cases.",

This includes the integration of marketing mix decisions, the longer-term effects of marketing mix decisions, and changes in the mix over time. For example: \"Price\" becomes \"Price Policy\", value-in-use, and price discrimination; \"Product\" becomes product line breadth and variety and product life cycle choices; \"Place\" becomes the design and control of single or multiple channels of distribution; and \"Promotion\" becomes communications, customer loyalty, and brand equity. The course will emphasize segmentation of the market, positioning the marketing mix to meet the needs of the market segment, sustaining an 'integrated' marketing mix over the product life cycle, and organizing the 'Strategic Business Unit' to implement the strategy. In addition to the development of a marketing strategy that 'positions' the product/service to the needs of one or more target markets (segmentation), the execution of a marketing strategy will require a marketing plan that includes the economic and financial analysis of the costs and potential profits of the strategy and an implementation plan including an organizational structure. This will often be an iterative process to find an optimal combination of costs and pricing and volume to maximize profits. This course will use readings, simulations, and cases for about half its content. The other half of the course will be a team consulting project for an external client.",

Among the topics that may be considered are: Defamation, the Right of Privacy, the Right to Publicity, Fraud and Deceit, Interference with Contractual Relations, Interference with Prospective Advantage, Injurious Falsehood, Malicious Prosecution, Abuse of Process, and various Statutory Torts. In addition, there will be a review of the so-called \"tort reforms\" enacted by Congress and state legislatures in recent years. Two credit hours.",

In an increasingly international world, the ability to obtain and maintain lawful immigration status in the U.S., permanent and temporary, is very important. This course focuses on the ways foreign-born persons can obtain permanent immigration status in the U.S. through their family and/or employment, both from abroad and from within the U.S. itself. However, it does so from a practice standpoint - how to analyze a client's situation, how to determine the best route to permanent resident status for a particular client, what resources are available, and how to navigate the maze of the Immigration Service and determine which form needs to be used, and where to file it. We will also examine the temporary statuses available to persons seeking to enter the U.S. to work or study, also from a practice standpoint. There are no prerequisites, but we strongly recommend that you have previously taken an Immigration Law class or have practical experience in immigration law. If this is your first exposure to immigration law, we welcome you to the class but please be aware that the assignments may be more time-consuming than you would normally find in a two credit hour course.",

    "description": "Emerging markets have been and will continue to be important sources of growth for multinational companies and other foreign investors. However, with the potential rewards of doing business in developing states come significant risks associated with navigating unstable political-economic systems and volatile regulatory frameworks. While cross border transactions in developed countries present myriad risks, many of the perils associated with projects in developing countries are more pronounced. Companies doing business in and with emerging market countries need to identify and manage political/economic risks and regulatory/legal risks that can destroy successful foreign direct investments and international trade projects. The type and scope of these risks vary by country and by project. Whereas a mining company extracting silver in Bolivia is exposed to expropriation risks, an international bank with branches in emerging markets might be more vulnerable to breaches of anti-money laundering regulations. As a U.S. exporter's risk analysis might focus on potential violations of international trade sanctions, global insurance companies are often more concerned about potential breaches of domestic and international anti-corruption laws. This course will introduce students to some of the risk analysis methods that multinational companies and their advisers use to identify the potential pitfalls of investing in emerging markets. These methods include but are not limited to political and economic risk analysis, reviews of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK's Bribery Act, identification of existing or future business practices that potentially violate international economic sanctions, and understanding how domestic and international anti-money laundering laws affect a parent company's subsidiaries around the world. International risk management tools safeguard multinational companies from significant losses that threaten the sustainability of cross border transactions in emerging market countries. This course will familiarize students with some of these risk management strategies. Examples of these tools include international trade and investment treaties, political risk and trade credit insurance, and in-house strategies and policies for managing exposures to financial crimes.\n\nCredit Hours\nTwo credit hours.",

It begins by exploring the structure of the American legal system and provides a preview of the various administrative agencies involved in regulating the financial markets. Using the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as an example, we will study some of the controversies that its creation engendered. In the second part of the course, the basic legal structure of a corporation, including the concept of limited liability and the fiduciary duties that a board of directors owes its shareholders, will be examined. With this background, the course demonstrates how a compliance system can protect both a corporation and its board of directors.",

Much of the subject matter is designed to allow the students to understand the risks associated with a design and provide the insight to reduce these risks to an acceptable level. The student gains an understanding of the methods available to measure reliability metrics and develops an appreciation for the impact manufacturing can have on product performance if careful attention is not paid to the influencing factors early in the development process. The discipline of software reliability is introduced, as well as the influence that maintainability has on performance reliability. The sequence culminates in an exhaustive review of the lesson plans in a way that empowers practicing or future engineers to implement their acquired knowledge in a variety of functional environments, organizations and industries. The group project for this class is a continuation of the previous course, with an emphasis on applying the tools and techniques introduced during this second of two courses.

    "description": "The second semester of the Master of Architecture focuses on the development of the fundamental aspects of form, space, structure, and materiality explored through the design of a small neighborhood library, which is an essential building-block of the city. The design-based investigation focuses on the study of spatial organization, public space, user experiences and basic tectonic principles, as well as examining the arrangement of and relations between the parts and elements of the urban environment. Through a series of assignments, students are guided step by step through the design process. The first part of the semester focuses on understanding the project\u2019s context through the careful investigation of current issues, historical and contemporary precedents, and an in-depth analysis and documentation of a particular site within a specific neighborhood in Chicago. This process is followed by forecasting, conceptual framing, and schematic explorations, and culminates with the strategic development and conceptual detailing of a building and its environs. Design projects are developed individually with the support of team research. A strong emphasis is placed on craft, making, the communication of ideas, and documentation of process. The semester culminates by assembling student portfolios of design work.",

Current conditions will be related historically to postwar reactions to modernism and contextually to the social and technological shifts of recent decades. With a focus on primary readings and building documentation, the course places an emphasis on the great complexity of social, political, intellectual, and technological forces affecting design.

Still a relatively new industry that continues to evolve at a breakneck pace, video games require lawyers to address substantive areas of law in new ways, particularly copyright and trademark law. The course follows a civilian approach to study persons in games, things in games, and how persons acquire things in games. Specific topics include: (a) special copyright considerations in video games, including fair use and DMCA protections; (b) games as entertainment products, and concerns of violent and mature content versus the value and protection of video games as speech under the First Amendment; (c) policing of video game content under self-regulation systems in the U.S. and Europe; (d) conflicts and compromises within the contractual relationships of game developers and game publishers; (e) the expanding role of gamers and their contributions to video games, such as through user-generated content, player communities, fan fiction, etc.; and (f) special legal challenges and controversies arising from online gaming and massively-multiplayer-online games (MMOs). Students will benefit from prior course work in intellectual property and other related topics, e.g., Copyright Law; Entertainment Law; Internet Law; or Trademarks and Unfair Competition, but these are not prerequisites. Students will be expected to write and present to the class a paper on a topic of their own choosing. Grading will be determined from the paper, presentation and class participation.",

The impact on the profession of architecture of the panoply of planning options and governmental goals is the result that the navigation of the system of mandated design determinates is one of the initial and potentially most creative acts in the process of project delivery.

    "description": "In today's global economy, world business leaders require advice regarding non-U.S. law, including the labor and employment laws that regulate their work forces. Moreover, and for similar reasons, labor advocates increasingly seek to hold countries accountable for failing to live up to international labor standards promulgated by the International Labor Organization (ILO) and other international bodies. They also try to hold lead firms that manage global value chains accountable to workers based on public and private sources of law, including corporate codes of conduct. Reformers also look at the labor and employment laws of other countries when they try to improve their national systems. International and comparative labor and employment law is therefore more than an academic curiosity. It is an important aspect of law practice and policy-making. In light of these considerations, this course surveys labor and employment laws and norms developed and promulgated by the ILO, the European Union, free trade agreements, and corporate codes. Comparatively, the course also focuses on the laws of the United States, Germany, and China, three leading world economies with vastly different labor and employment law systems. While the course does not aim to make students \"experts\" in any one jurisdiction, it teaches students to make informed questions, including to local counsel, when they encounter cross-border, employment-related legal issues. The course will also guide students to understand why countries have different systems of labor and employment protection despite the fact that they all try to solve similar problems, and how the U.S. is, or is not, unique.\n\nCredit Hours\nTwo credit hours.",

After initial training and instruction about the dynamics of domestic violence, the Illinois law governing protection orders, and the operation of the domestic violence courthouse, students will work with clients at the courthouse (555 W. Harrison, two blocks from the law school) for six hours per week. Students may choose when they will perform their hours week by week. Work with the clients at the courthouse will include helping clients fill out petitions for emergency protection orders, advising clients on their cases, and perhaps even speaking for clients in court. In addition, we will periodically meet on Friday afternoons to discuss the issues and challenges students confront.",

Thus the aim of this course is to give students insights into ECM biology and its relevance to modern medicine and biomedical (tissue) engineering. A significant portion of working population is suffering from ECM-related maladies, and the focus of research has shifted into creating ECM implants. The ECM implant market is growing rapidly. For instance, the collagen meniscus implant market was reported to be at $308.6 million in 20181. Understanding the implications of the molecular biology of ECM to feed into this research is highly relevant for students considering careers (academic and industry) in life sciences in industry, academia and healthcare.\nExtracellular Matrix (ECM) is a highly complex system in mammalian biology responsible for structural support and functional (biochemical) signals for physiology. Specific amino acid sequences on the various ECM elements are responsible to trigger intra- and extracellular cascades leading to cell division, proliferation, tissue regeneration, wound healing and inflammation. This course will focus on the following key concepts:\na) Gene expression, structure and function of various ECM proteins and complexes and the physiological processes.\nb) Etiology and the molecular progression of diseases caused by abnormalities to ECM proteins.\nc) Mechanobiology of various ECM proteins.\nd) Structure function and mechanical function of ECM interfaces with other tissues (muscle, bone, skin etc.)\ne) Implications for tissue engineering and development of novel biomimetic and biological ECM implants.",
